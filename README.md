# Cookiecutter for django-SHOP

Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter), **cookiecutter-django-shop** is a set of templates
for jumpstarting a **django-SHOP** project quickly.

> Note: This documentation refers to the upcoming release 1.0.0 of django-SHOP. If you are looking for
  version 0.12.x, please check here: https://github.com/awesto/cookiecutter-django-shop/tree/releases/0.12

Use these Cookiecutter Templates to run one of the demo merchant implementations.

* Use them to get a first impression on its features.
* Select the configuration example which is the most similar to your own requirements. Then replace the
  product models and templates with your own implementations.


## Quick How-To

Install [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) onto your operating system, for instance

on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-cookiecutter pipenv autopep8 nodejs npm
```

on MacOS

```bash
sudo brew install cookiecutter pipenv autopep8 node
```

> Note: If `pipenv` is not available through your package manager, try with `pip install pipenv`.

then change into your projects directory and invoke

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/awesto/cookiecutter-django-shop
```

You will be asked a few question. If unsure just the the defaults. This creates a directory named `my-shop`,
or whatever you have choosen. This generated directory is named the *merchant implementation*, for easiness
let's refer it as `my-shop` in the following text. This directory is where the merchant keeps its
configurations, adds his own Django models and overrides the templates.


## Run django-SHOP demo locally

Running the django-SHOP demo locally is probably the best choice, when you want to experiment with
alternative product models and hence want to edit the code generated by the Cookiecutter template.

```bash
cd my-shop
pipenv install --sequential
npm install
pipenv run ./manage.py initialize_shop_demo
export DJANGO_DEBUG=1
pipenv run ./manage.py runserver
```

After the above job has finished, point a browser onto http://localhost:8000/ and login with user
*admin* and password *secret*.

This demo uses SQLite as its database. It does neither support caching, nor full text searches.


## Run django-SHOP demo in Docker
------------------------------

If you anserwed the Cookiecutter builder with YES to `use_docker`, the merchant implementation is build
with Docker support.

> Note: This feature is not fully tested yet and might not work as expected.

Running the django-SHOP demo inside a Docker container, allows you to test all features such as full text search, proper
caching, running asynchronous tasks and uses a Postgres database. Check that your Docker machine is running, if unsure
invoke `docker-machine ip`.

```bash
cd my-shop
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Point a browser onto http://<docker-machine-ip>:9009/ and start surfing. Determine the IP address using
``docker-machine ip``.

In case you want to access the Django admin interface, log in as *admin* with password *secret*.


## Where to proceed from here?

Now that you have a simple working project, it usually is much easier to evolve into a real project for the merchant's
needs. Remember that there are 3 different ways to arrange your product models:
 * `commodity`: If you want to use a freeform CMS page to describe your products. It is usually the best solution
   if you only have a handful of products, or if the kind of product differs a lot.
 * `smartcard`: If you have one concrete product model for all products in your shop.
 * `polymorphic`: If you have different kinds of products, each requiring their own concrete product model.

By answering the Cookiecutter builder with YES to `use_i18n`, multilingual support is added to the project. Currently
only English and German are configured, but this can easily be changed by adopting the LANGUAGE parameters in the
project's `settings.py`.

By answering the Cookiecutter builder with YES to `use_paypal`, [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) support is added to
the project. You have to apply for PayPal credentials and add them to your environment or into the project's
`settings.py`.

By answering the Cookiecutter builder with YES to `use_stripe`, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) support is added to the
project. Currently you may use the sandbox credentials provided with the demo, but feel free to apply for your own
ones and add them to the appropriate parameters in your `settings.py`.

By answering the Cookiecutter builder with YES to `use_sendcloud`, [SendCloud](https://www.sendcloud.com/) support is
added to the project. You have to apply for your own ones credentials, as SendCloud does not offer any sandboxing.
